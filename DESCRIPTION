Description: The GCAM dashboard is an interactive tool for exploring collections
    of GCAM scenarios. Its purpose is not to show everything a user might want to
    know about a scenario, but rather to allow users to quickly get a sense of the
    key features of a scenario and how a group of related scenarios are similar to
    and different from one another.
