Version: 0.4.6
Authors@R: person("Robert", "Link", email = "robert.link@pnnl.gov", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides tools for extracting data from GCAM
    output databases and importing that data into R for analysis.  The
    central concept in rgcam is the "project data file", which
    contains an R representation of the GCAM data.  The package
    provides functions to add results from GCAM queries to a project
    file, load data, and perform maintenance on project data (such as
    cleaning out unneeded scenarios).  The data structures created and
    loaded by this package are compatible with the GCAM analysis tools
    written and supported by the GCAM team.
